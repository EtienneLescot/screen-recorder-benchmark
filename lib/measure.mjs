/**
 * Measurement primitives.
 *
 * Three things have to be true for an export timing to mean anything:
 *   1. The clock starts at the moment the export is *committed*, not when the app launched.
 *   2. The clock stops when the output file is *complete*, not when a progress bar hits 100%.
 *   3. The output is verified to be what was asked for — an app that quietly writes 720p, or a
 *      12-second file from a 60-second source, is not faster, it is wrong.
 *
 * Everything here is app-agnostic on purpose: the same stopwatch is used for the CLI drivers
 * and the UI drivers, so a CLI app is not credited for skipping a step a GUI app must do.
