/**
 * The rest of a real recording: a wallpaper, a webcam track, and cursor telemetry.
 *
 * The first version of this benchmark fed the apps a screen clip and nothing else, and that
 * measured the wrong thing. An export in this category is not a transcode with a coloured
 * border — it is a compositor pass that samples a background image, transforms and masks the
 * recording, renders a *synthetic* cursor from telemetry with smoothing and motion blur, draws
 * a webcam inset with its own mask and shadow, and motion-blurs the whole thing. Leave the
 * cursor and the camera out and the expensive half of the pipeline never runs.
 *
 * Two consequences shape this file:
 *
 * 1. **The cursor must not be drawn into the source.** These apps hide the system pointer while
 *    recording and re-render it at export time from a sidecar. Baking a cursor into the pixels
 *    would exercise nothing and would double-draw once an app rendered its own. So the
 *    trajectory is generated here, written in each app's telemetry format by its driver, and
 *    the screen clip is left clean.
 * 2. **Everything is generated from the same seed**, so a second machine reproduces the whole
 *    bundle — wallpaper, webcam and cursor path included — and can prove it by hash.
