/**
 * OpenScreen, headless.

 * The subject of the benchmark, driven through its own `openscreen export` command. The

 * byte-reproducible — see lib/openscreenProject.mjs.
 *
 * Because this path skips the UI entirely it is *not* directly comparable to Screen Studio's
 * or a UI-driven tool's numbers; `openscreen-gui` exists for that comparison, and the report keeps
 * two rows apart.
